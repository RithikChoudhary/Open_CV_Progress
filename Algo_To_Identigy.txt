We have 3 factores 
these all for gray scale image


Lightness The graylevel will be calculated as

Lightness = ½ × (max(R,G,B) + min(R,G,B))

Luminosity The graylevel will be calculated as

Luminosity = 0.21 × R + 0.72 × G + 0.07 × B

Average The graylevel will be calculated as

Average Brightness = (R + G + B) ÷ 3


4th factor is the color of the image at each pixel in RGB image
from PIL import Image
 
# creating a image object
im = Image.open(r"C:\Users\System-Pc\Desktop\leave.jpg")
px = im.load()
print (px[4, 4])
px[4, 4] = (0, 0, 0)
print (px[4, 4])
coordinate = x, y = 150, 59
# using getpixel method
print (im.getpixel(coordinate));
